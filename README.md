EDUCATIONAL PURPOSE ! A modernized and fully refactored version of the 2016–2017 project. The legacy code was written for Python 2.7, using outdated dependencies and deprecated methods, making the tool unusable in 2025. This repository provides a clean, stable, and secure Python 3 implementation rewritten with modern standards. Working and stable.
